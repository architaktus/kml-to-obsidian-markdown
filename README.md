# google earth kml to obsidian markdown
a simple py, batch convert kml into obsidian markdown files and folders - they should work with Obsidian plugin Mapview (https://github.com/esm7/obsidian-map-view)
转换谷歌地图的标注和说明为md及文件夹

# requirement
**pykml** (https://pythonhosted.org/pykml/)
pip install pykml

# for someone doesn't know anything about python like me some days ago
* have python installed
* run the .bat "pip pykml.bat" to install module "pykml"
* put kml in the same folder as "kml2md.py" and "runme.bat"
* run the .bat "runme.bat" to start the batch
* you got everything. :)

# Note
* it doesn't support path, as the Obsidian Plugin Mapview doesn't support it for now.
